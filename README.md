# LandingPage
this is the first project in the web professional track

in this project I wrote Html and CSS and JS to construct and style and give functionality to this very first Landing Page.

in this page I have made some feautures:

1- make it responsive on mobiles, tablets and laptops.

2- make the navigation menu collapsable.

3-adding sections to the page will automatically add links to the nav bar

4-there is a button bottom right in the page to send the user to the top of the page when he scrolls down the fold of the page.

5- there is an indicator that this section that you scrolled into is in the viewport or not and give the section an active class.

6- the link the user click on became active button and has some special styling to differ it from other links.

7- user when not scrolling after a certain time the navigation menu disappears and appears again when he scrolls again.
